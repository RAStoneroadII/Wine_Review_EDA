# Wine_Review_EDA
## Overview
Using an initial dataset from Kaggle, and other sources, I look to answer how a winery would break into the market with a high likelihood of success.
This project largely involves me applying classical statistical methodology to data, and then visualizing it with the matplotlib.pyplot library. The graphcs will then be compiled into a report for stakeholders to read and process.
